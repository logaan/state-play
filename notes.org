* Observations
** Calling forceUpdate() on the root causes the email component to re-render
* Tasks
** TODO try it with setState() on the root
** TODO try it with immutable.js
* Goal
** minimal boilerplate
** minimal re-rendering
** boringly obvious data flow
** no use of this
* How minimal can we get?
** Controllers can't be functional
*** Controllers can make Ajax calls, set timers, and do other async things
*** They need to be able to change the state based on the result of those async things
*** They may also need to respond in the future to the state of the application at that time
**** So they'll need to make calls to getState
*** This means they can't be pure functions.
**** They could be if we had them return something like an IO monad
***** But that's not helping anyone
* Test case
** Username field
*** Flow
**** User enters username
**** We check with the server whether it's already taken
**** We update the error information for the field
***** Only if the name has not changed since we checked
*** Interesting points
**** Our response to user input has an async action
***** We would like to be able to handle this with async/await
***** Or at the very least .then() chains
***** Redux would have us return thunks?
**** We need a copy of the original value and the new
**** We're writing back to the state
